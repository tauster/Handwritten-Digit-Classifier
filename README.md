# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classifier
#### _k-Nearest Neighbors & Logistic Regression machine learning implementation for the MNIST handwritten digits dataset_

This assignment compares the performance and characteristics of the k-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression classifiers. The dataset used is the MNIST handwritten digits. For this assignment specifically, the hand-written digits, 2 and 8, represented as 28x28 pixel arrays are being used.

Dataset Description:
* `mnist_train.npz`
  * Contains 100 examples of each class
* `mnist_train_small.npz`
  * Contains 5 examples of each class
* `mnist_valid.npz`
  * Validation set with 25 examples each class used for model selection
* `mnist_test.npz`
  * Final test set
